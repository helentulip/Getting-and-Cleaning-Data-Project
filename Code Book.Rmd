#Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Project

##Overview
Source of the original data:

Full Description at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
##Process

The script run_analysis.R performs the following process to clean up the data and create tiny data sets:

Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.

Reads features.txt and uses only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Reads activity_labels.txt and name the activities data in a human readable way.

Labels the data set with descriptive names. 

Merges the features with activity labels and subjects. The output is saved as tidyData.txt.

The average of each measurement for each activity and each subject is merged to a second data set. The output is saved as tidyData2.txt.

##Variables

- testData - table contents of test/X_test.txt
- trainData - table contents of train/X_train.txt
- X - Measurement data. Combined data set of the two above variables
- testSub - table contents of test/subject_test.txt
- trainSub - table contents of test/subject_train.txt
- S - Subjects. Combined data set of the two above variables
- testLabel - table contents of test/y_test.txt
- trainLabel - table contents of train/y_train.txt
- Y - Data Labels. Combined data set of the two above variables.
- features - Names of for data columns 
- keeplogic - logical vector of which features to use in tidy data set
- activities - table contents of activity_labels.txt. Human readable
- tidyData - subsetted, human-readable data ready for output according to - - project description.
- uniqueS - unique subjects from S
- num_uniqueS - number of unique subjects
- num_Activity - number of activities
- num_Col - number of columns in tidyData
- td - second tiny data set with average of each variable for each activity and subject

##Output

- tidyData.txt

tidyData.txt is a data frame with 10299 rows and 68 columns.

The first column is subject.
The second column is activity names.
Columns 63-68 are measurements.
Subjects are integers between 1 and 30.

- tidyData2.txt

tidyData2.txt is a 180x68 data frame with 180 rows and 68 columns.

The first column is subject.
The second column is activity names.
Columns 3-68 are the averages for each of the 66 measurements.
